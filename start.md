# Get Started

## 1. Install Dependencies
Your first need to install some dependencies to correctly compile Cengine source code.

### SDL2

- libsdl2-dev - Simple DirectMedia Layer development files
- libsdl2-dev - Image loading library for Simple DirectMedia Layer 2, development files
- libsdl2-ttf-dev - TrueType Font library for Simple DirectMedia Layer 2, development files

In Ubuntu you can simply install the packages from the repos by typing:

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`

### Pthreads

If the pthreads library is not installed on your system, install it (in Ubuntu) by running:

`sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev`
