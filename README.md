# Cengine

**Cengine** is a cross-platform development framework, created by Ermiry, designed to provide you with easy access to audio, input, graphics, rendering and much more. It is developed on top of the SDL (Simple Direct Media) Library to access low level methods.

**Cengine** was originally created to support the development of native Linux games, but over time it has expanded to have other modules and features as well.

- The main module (core) gives the developer access to common operations such as 2D rendering (using textures), input management (mouse, keyboard, joysticks), audio, animations, files, windows, and more.
- The game module gives you access to the original methods intended for game development. It uses a simple, yet powerful, ECS (Entity Component System) with predefined components, but the developer can add components of their own to the base units: GameObjects.
- The UI module is one of the largest and provides **Cengine** with robust UI capabilities that can help in the creation of amazing apps, not only games. It has common elements such as text boxes, text inputs, images, dropdowns; but it also has some custom ones such as a notification center.
- The networking module lets you create a client in simple steps that can connect with any server directly and send and receive packages. But is also intended to work directly with Cerver (Ermiry's server framework).

**Cengine** is best optimized and with greater functionality in Linux platforms, but over time it has also increased support for  Mac OS and Windows platforms as well, but it is important to note that they are more limited in functionalities like granular thread control, low level network access for fast and reliable transmissions, among other things.

**Cengine** is open source and its code is heavily documented out of the box, but if you need additional explanation of its methods, or you want to check some quick examples, you can check the official documentation here: cengine.ermiry.com/docs

**Cengine** is currently on the first release (1.0) and is the result of more than a year of development and constant learning. It all started as a small project but it has became one of the core components of Ermiry. You can expect many feature updates that will enhance even more your experience.
